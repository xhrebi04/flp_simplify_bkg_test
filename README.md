# SIMPLIFY-BKG TEST


## HOW TO RUN SCRIPT
1) Copy YOUR_PROJECT to same directory as tests folder and testMyProject.sh
2) build your projekt 
3) chmod +x testMyProject.sh 
4) ./testMyProject.sh  

## IMPORTANT
Script comparing files is based on diff command. So if your test ends with FAILED **it may not be a bad output**, because nonTerminal and terminal symbols may be in different order.
