SIMPLIFY-BKG TEST
===========

HOW TO RUN SCRIPT
===========
Copy <yourProject>.sh to same directory as tests folder and testMyProject.sh
chmod +x testMyProject.sh
./testMyProject.sh

IMPORTANT
===========
Script comparing files is based on diff command. So if your test ends with FAILED it may not be a bad output, because nonTerminal and terminal symbols may be in different order.
